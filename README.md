# Text Twist Solver

The solver is written in javascript so you need to have node.js installed to run it.

Just run from the command line:
```
node solver.js <scrambled_letters>
```

Works with any number of letters and uses a slightly modified version of the linux standard dictionary (/usr/share/dict/words).

Only finds words that are 3 letters or more.
